## Abstract
This research took a comparative analysis on string matching algorithms. The study focused on developing an efficient algorithm (Back-navigation String matching algorithm) which will be used for large documents. The algorithm whilst compared to the existing system introduced a pattern of search which was done backwardly, from the last character to the first. ...

## Introduction
The BSMA is designed to address inefficiencies in existing string matching algorithms, particularly for large documents. ...

## Methodology
The research methodology adopted for this project research is the verification and validation methodology which perform its test in a reverse manner ...

## Conclusion
The Back-Navigation String Matching Algorithm (BSMA) presents a novel approach to string matching, focusing on optimizing search efficiency for large documents. This algorithm introduces a backward search pattern, starting from the last character of the pattern, which aims to minimize comparisons and enhance overall performance in string matching tasks.
